This project is a React web page + FastAPI backend to simulate an early warning system for a weather crisis. Its 2 main functions are:
    1. Real-Time Weather Reports
      We implemented an API and dynamic front-end to fetch data from U.S. National Weather Service. It extracts and displays key weather measurements as well as analyzes the condition and returning an alert (low, moderate, high, severe).
    2. Maximum Weather Station Coverage
      This feature assigns which region each station covers and choosing K stations to maximize region coverage. It displays a grid on the front-end showing covered and uncovered regions.

To run this project, simply use the launch configuration which runs the FastAPI backend + React front-end and automatically open the webpage.
